        Northern Territory might be the smallest Australian state or territory in terms of population, but there are plenty of reasons why it is one of the top destinations for international students.

        <h6>A community that welcomes people from all over the world</h6>
        <p>
        Darwin, the capital of Northern Territory (NT) is a multicultural city with a strong indigenous population and one-third of its residents born overseas, making it a welcoming and diverse option for international students. There are dozens of groups and organisations you can connect with, in which they come together for the Darwin Waterfront Harmony Soiree in May to celebrate the cultural richness of the NT. Student homestay program through the Australian Homestay Network can also connect you with a host family who will give you a warm welcome to Australia, teach you about local customs and help you settle in as you begin your studies in Darwin.
        </p>
        <h6>Darwin city is beautiful, warm and close to nature</h6>
        <p>
        The NT is home to some amazing wildlife and has lots of cool places to swim and cool off. For instance in Darwin, you can come face-to-face with a crocodile at Crocosaurus Cove and visit some wildlife in Wave Lagoon on Darwin Waterfront and Howard Springs Reserve where turtles, wallabies and native birds linger around the rockpools. Other interesting activities are the Deckchair Cinema which provides free outdoor movies between May and October, the Greek Glenti in June, and the weekly markets at Nightcliff, Mindil Beach and Parap in the dry season.
        </p>
        <h6>Smaller class sizes</h6>
        <p>
        Smaller class sizes allow you to concentrate on your studies and start up your career in a positive way. You will likely to receive way more attention, mentoring and engagement from your lecturers, tutors and mentors. Smaller class sizes also enable you to build a support network of friends and a job network that could be helpful post studies. This can ensure greater success in your later job career as benefited from close contact with them as a means of focusing on your career ambitions and direction.
        </p>
        <h6>State Nomination For Skilled Migrants</h6>
        <p>
        If you study in the NT for at least 2 years and complete a minimum Diploma course, you will be able to claim 5 extra points in the Points Test, if you are applying for one of the visas that are points tested. The NT Government may be also interested in nominating you to support your visa application under one of the nominated general skilled migration visa subclasses if you have a skilled occupation that is in demand in Australia’s top end.
        </p>
        <h6>Darwin is home to a wealth of indigenous culture</h6>
        <p>
        The Aboriginal people of Australia have a rich, living culture stretching more than 50,000 years. In Darwin, you can meet artists at work at one of the city’s many Aboriginal art galleries, such as the Readback Book Exchange and Aboriginal Art Gallery in the CBD. To learn indigenous culture in a different light, you may take a tour led by an indigenous guide and study about the Larrakia people’s Dreamtime stories. By learning other cultures, we will eventually grow our understanding of ourselves and be enriched by another way of thinking about the world.
        </p>
        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>
        When you study in Darwin, you will be living in a place completely different from the rest of Australia. It is unadulterated and as genuine as an Aussie experience you can get. Furthermore, it is filled with limitless opportunities. From breathtaking natural surrounds to friendly community and learning experience, there is very little reason not to study in the NT.
